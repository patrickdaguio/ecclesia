## Description

I designed and developed Ecclesia for a friend who wanted to showcase their Animal Crossing island and its features with the goal of bringing in more visitors to their island in hopes to build a community.

You will find interactivity throughout the website from full-page animations, icons and images through the use of GSAP. Website also includes an image slider and photo galleries with autoplay.

> "Old design" gallery will pause autoplay when hovered
